                        <b>The first ever Formula One World Champion </b>came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers.
                        A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by
                        man of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for
                        their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident.

                        Many consider him to be <b>the greatest driver of all time.</b> In seven full Formula One seasons (he missed one recovering from a nearly fatal injury) he was World Champion five times (with four different teams) and runner-up twice. In his 51 championship Grands Prix he started from the front row 48 times (including 29 pole positions) and set 23 fastest race laps en route to 35 podium finishes, 24 of them victories. His superlative track record was achieved by some of the greatest displays of skill and daring ever seen. Fangio did it all with style, grace, nobility and a sense of honour never seen before or since.

                        The son of one of Italy's great pre-war drivers, Alberto Ascari went on to become one of <b> Formula One racing's most dominant and best-loved champions. </b>Noted for the careful precision and finely-judged accuracy that made him one of the safest drivers in a most dangerous era, he was also notoriously superstitious and took great pains to avoid tempting fate. But his unexplained fatal accident - at exactly the same age as his father’s, on the same day of the month and in eerily similar circumstances - remains one of Formula One racing’s great unsolved mysteries.

When his pastime became a profession he partied as hard as he drove, though his career was also tinged by tragedy, scandal and personal misfortune. Near the end he found Formula One racing no fun at all, but he went out a winner. Other champions were greater drivers <b>but none was a more colourful personality.</b></p>

                        Jack Brabham's three world championships were the product of both his engineering expertise and driving skill. His first two titles, in rear-engined Coopers he helped develop, confirmed the obsolescence of front-engined Formula One cars. His third title, in a Brabham, made him the <b>only driver to become champion in a car of his own make.</b> For his lifetime achievements, which also included nurturing the talents of other notable drivers and pioneering the business side of the sport, he became <b>the first Formula One driver to receive a knighthood.</b>

                        He never intended to make racing a way of life, let alone become <b>the best in the world in a sport that for him began as farm boy's hobby.</b> And when the sport took Jim Clark's life the racing world mourned the loss of one of its best-loved champions, the unassuming Scottish driving genius whose personal integrity and admirable human qualities endeared him to fans and rivals alike. Nearly invincible in the car, he seemed vulnerable out of it and was always a reluctant hero. Few champions were as dominant. Fewer still are remembered so fondly.

                        Famed as the <b>only World Champion on both two and four wheels,</b> John Surtees rode motorcycles and drove Formula One cars with equal skill and bravery. He made the leap from bikes to cars with surprising ease, though his quick climb to the pinnacle of motorsport was also the result of a great deal of hard effort by a serious-minded driver whose fierce independence ultimately proved to be a handicap. Having won the driving title at Ferrari, he left after a violent argument and was thereafter ill-equipped to win consistently.

Yet he was also a sensitive man unable to express his feelings, except in a racing car, in which he was an accomplished if unspectacular driver.

Few threw themselves into the fray with such vigour, nor did many measure up to Rindt's status as a colourful character.<b> Fiercely determined and resolutely independent,</b> he had a rough and tumble allure seldom seen before or since.

                        The youngest World Champion at the time achieved that distinction through circumstances that threw him in at the deep end while he was still relatively wet behind the ears. But 'Emmo' rose superbly to the challenge, <b>winning his first driving title at 25 and his second two years later.</b> Thereafter, dragged under by a disastrous career move, he sank to the bottom leaving hardly a trace of past glory. Yet his status as a popular champion and spokesman for the sport remains intact and he is also credited with serving as the inspiration for the influx of Brazilian drivers that followed him into Formula One racing.

Instead, he straightened himself out and concentrated his considerable talent and ambition on becoming World Champion. <b>Having achieved his goal (with Ferrari, whose next champion would be 21 years in the future), he quickly retired.</b>

                        A straight-talking, iron-willed, hard-driving tough guy,<b> Alan Jones fought his way to the forefront,</b> where he defended his territory with ruthless determination and large doses of intimidation. His belligerence was partly a by-product of a long and hard struggle to make it to Formula One racing in the first place. Once there, he was considered little more than a journeyman driver, until he teamed up with the then equally undistinguished Williams team. Together, they took on the world and beat it, with AJ becoming the prototypical Williams driver.

                        His place in Formula One history as one of the sport's greatest drivers is secure, though a career full of conflict and controversy detracted somewhat from his considerable achievements. <b>He won four championships</b> but also left teams acrimoniously on four occasions. He made winning races - 51 times - look easy but was less successful at the politics in which he was invariably embroiled. His bitter feud with Ayrton Senna brought out the best and worst in them both. And yet among the champions only Michael Schumacher and Juan Manuel Fangio won more crowns than Alain Prost.

                        He streaked through the sport like a comet, an other-worldly superstar whose brilliance as a driver was matched by a dazzling intellect and coruscating charisma that illuminated Formula One racing as never before. <b>No one tried harder or pushed himself further,</b> nor did anyone shed so much light on the extremes to which only the greatest drivers go. Intensely introspective and passionate in the extreme, Ayrton Senna endlessly sought to extend his limits, to go faster than himself, a quest that ultimately made him a martyr but did not diminish his mystique.

Hugely determined, immensely aggressive and spectacularly daring, he was one of the most exciting drivers ever.

                        Judging by the record books Jacques Villeneuve had a Formula One career in reverse. He nearly won the driving title in his debut year, did so in his second season, then went steadily downhill and eventually dropped right out of the sport. Yet the statistical rise and fall of the son of one of the greatest racing heroes was not an accurate reflection of his driving ability, nor do the numbers do justice to his impact as <b>one of the most colourful and controversial champions.</b> As a distinctive personality he stood alone and in terms of his entertainment value he had few peers.

                        He never said much, preferring to let his driving speak for itself. And it spoke volumes for the laid-back Flying Finn who always drove flat out. Everybody liked the silent star and nobody begrudged the success of the brave man who was nearly killed before he achieved it. Consistent as well as quick, he scored points in over half his races, taking his lop-sided grin to the top of the podium on 20 occasions. <b>In their 11 years as rivals the only driver who achieved more was Michael Schumacher, who said the opponent he most respected was Mika Hakkinen.</b>

In 2013, and still just 26 years old, he made short work of becoming the youngest ever quadruple world champion.

It seemed a far-fetched fantasy, even for a boy benefitting from a privileged upbringing in Monaco. <b>Indeed it took 25 years of hard effort for Nico to make his childhood dream come true.</b> His championship quest took a heavy toll, prompting a final twist in the tale of triumph. Five days after taking the title, in a dramatic last-race showdown with his team mate Lewis Hamilton, the 2016 World Champion announced his immediate retirement from the pinnacle of motorsport.
