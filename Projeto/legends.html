                        <b>The first ever Formula One World Champion </b>came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers.
                        A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by
                        man of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for
                        their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident.

                        Many consider him to be <b>the greatest driver of all time.</b> In seven full Formula One seasons (he missed one recovering from a nearly fatal injury) he was World Champion five times (with four different teams) and runner-up twice. In his 51 championship Grands Prix he started from the front row 48 times (including 29 pole positions) and set 23 fastest race laps en route to 35 podium finishes, 24 of them victories. His superlative track record was achieved by some of the greatest displays of skill and daring ever seen.

But his unexplained fatal accident - at exactly the same age as his father’s, on the same day of the month and in eerily similar circumstances - remains one of Formula One racing’s great unsolved mysteries.

Near the end he found Formula One racing no fun at all, but he went out a winner. Other champions were greater drivers <b>but none was a more colourful personality.</b></p>

                        In the record books he is notable for being the only posthumous World Champion. But before he was killed Jochen Rindt had carved himself a memorable niche in the small but select category of heroes whose voracious appetite for raw racing was demonstrably apparent in a daredevil driving style that was both thrilling and worrying to watch. Few threw themselves into the fray with such vigour, nor did many measure up to Rindt's status as a colourful character.<b> Fiercely determined and resolutely independent,</b> he had a rough and tumble allure seldom seen before or since.

                        The youngest World Champion at the time achieved that distinction through circumstances that threw him in at the deep end while he was still relatively wet behind the ears. But 'Emmo' rose superbly to the challenge, <b>winning his first driving title at 25 and his second two years later.</b> Thereafter, dragged under by a disastrous career move, he sank to the bottom leaving hardly a trace of past glory. Yet his status as a popular champion and spokesman for the sport remains intact and he is also credited with serving as the inspiration for the influx of Brazilian drivers that followed him into Formula One racing.

                        He bought his way into Formula 1 racing and very nearly paid for it with his life. Given up for dead after an appalling accident he recovered by what the medical profession called sheer force of will. His astonishingly quick return to the cockpit was called the most courageous comeback in sporting history. After winning two championships he got bored and left the sport, only to return again and win another. During his remarkable career he was called both a hero and a villain. <b>The battle-scarred champion who defied both the odds and convention remains a sporting legend.</b>

                        James Hunt's was a turbulent life lived to the limit - in and out of racing cars. As a driver he overcame constant fear and enormous odds to become the best in the world - triumphing in one of the most dramatic championship battles in Formula One history. As a colourful personality and unconventional character he had no peers - alternately entertaining admirers and offending critics with his often outrageous behaviour. After he retired he continued to make a strong impact, as a TV commentator, but <b>died suddenly in the prime of his life.</b>

                       <b> Mario Andretti personified the American Dream,</b> an immigrant who came to the land of the free and the home of the brave and achieved considerable fame and fortune. He did so in a job he would have done in anonymity and for nothing. Few drivers loved their racing more, and few suited stardom as much as the congenial man whose unforced charm was as natural as the talent that brought him so much success in so many types of racing. His insistence on racing in his adopted homeland meant he came late to realising his boyhood ambition of becoming Formula One World Champion.

                        He exploded on the scene as an erratic, crash-prone wild man whose desperate deeds of derring-do put himself and his peers in great danger. Jody Scheckter became infamous for causing one of the biggest accidents in Formula One history, after which there were demands that he should be banned from the sport. Instead, he straightened himself out and concentrated his considerable talent and ambition on becoming World Champion. <b>Having achieved his goal (with Ferrari, whose next champion would be 21 years in the future), he quickly retired.</b>
