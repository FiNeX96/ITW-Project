                        <b>The first ever Formula One World Champion </b>came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers.
                        A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by
                        man of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for
                        their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident.

                        Many consider him to be <b>the greatest driver of all time.</b> In seven full Formula One seasons (he missed one recovering from a nearly fatal injury) he was World Champion five times (with four different teams) and runner-up twice. In his 51 championship Grands Prix he started from the front row 48 times (including 29 pole positions) and set 23 fastest race laps en route to 35 podium finishes, 24 of them victories. His superlative track record was achieved by some of the greatest displays of skill and daring ever seen.

But his unexplained fatal accident - at exactly the same age as his father’s, on the same day of the month and in eerily similar circumstances - remains one of Formula One racing’s great unsolved mysteries.

Near the end he found Formula One racing no fun at all, but he went out a winner. Other champions were greater drivers <b>but none was a more colourful personality.</b></p>

                        In the record books he is notable for being the only posthumous World Champion. But before he was killed Jochen Rindt had carved himself a memorable niche in the small but select category of heroes whose voracious appetite for raw racing was demonstrably apparent in a daredevil driving style that was both thrilling and worrying to watch. Few threw themselves into the fray with such vigour, nor did many measure up to Rindt's status as a colourful character.<b> Fiercely determined and resolutely independent,</b> he had a rough and tumble allure seldom seen before or since.

                        The youngest World Champion at the time achieved that distinction through circumstances that threw him in at the deep end while he was still relatively wet behind the ears. But 'Emmo' rose superbly to the challenge, <b>winning his first driving title at 25 and his second two years later.</b> Thereafter, dragged under by a disastrous career move, he sank to the bottom leaving hardly a trace of past glory. Yet his status as a popular champion and spokesman for the sport remains intact and he is also credited with serving as the inspiration for the influx of Brazilian drivers that followed him into Formula One racing.

                        He bought his way into Formula 1 racing and very nearly paid for it with his life. Given up for dead after an appalling accident he recovered by what the medical profession called sheer force of will.

After winning two championships he got bored and left the sport, only to return again and win another.

                        Judging by the record books Jacques Villeneuve had a Formula One career in reverse. He nearly won the driving title in his debut year, did so in his second season, then went steadily downhill and eventually dropped right out of the sport. Yet the statistical rise and fall of the son of one of the greatest racing heroes was not an accurate reflection of his driving ability, nor do the numbers do justice to his impact as <b>one of the most colourful and controversial champions.</b> As a distinctive personality he stood alone and in terms of his entertainment value he had few peers.

                        He never said much, preferring to let his driving speak for itself. And it spoke volumes for the laid-back Flying Finn who always drove flat out. Everybody liked the silent star and nobody begrudged the success of the brave man who was nearly killed before he achieved it. Consistent as well as quick, he scored points in over half his races, taking his lop-sided grin to the top of the podium on 20 occasions. <b>In their 11 years as rivals the only driver who achieved more was Michael Schumacher, who said the opponent he most respected was Mika Hakkinen.</b>

                        The 28th Formula 1 World Drivers' Champion was at the time the youngest ever. Just 24 years old, Fernando Alonso also led the Renault team to the 2005 Constructors' Championship, thus ending the reign of the Michael Schumacher-Ferrari combination that had dominated for so long. <b>The precocious and personable youngster who made so much history so soon comfortably wore the crown </b>- a bright, polished, perfectly poised new star. Confirmation of his brilliance came in 2006 when he successfully defended his title against strong opposition from Schumacher, whose subsequent retirement left Alonso well-placed to succeed him as Formula 1's resident superstar...

                        Fast-tracked into the sport with the shortest CV on four wheels, the unknown newcomer who came from nowhere and said next to nothing immediately proved he knew exactly what he was doing: driving a Formula 1 car as fast as it could possibly go. The car couldn't always keep up with his talent and it took seven seasons for Kimi 'Iceman' Raikkonen to become World Champion. Notoriously inanimate and uncommunicative, the silent speedster's frozen expression in fact masked the hidden depths in <b>one of the most original - and popular - characters in the sport's history.</b>
